This is a game for autistic children (normal people can also use it). It is my project that I worked on and the method of this game is that there are LEDs that must be clicked on by the user and the location of the LEDs can be changed. This finds and increases the connection of vision and hand nerves by using color and movement and hand nerve movements and eye control. Totally fun.
